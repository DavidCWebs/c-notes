Programme Design
================
Seven Design Steps
------------------

### Algorithm Design
1. Work through a specific instance
2. Record specific steps taken in step 1
3. Generalize steps from step 2
4. Test the steps

### Code Design
5. Translate the algorithm determined in steps 1 - 4 to code
6. Test the programme created in step 5
7. Debug programme, refine if necessary

Algorithm to Code
-----------------

### Top Down Design
Taking large complex pieces and separating into functions is known as top-down design.

### Composability
The ability to put things together and have them work as expected: __composability__.
